# Hangman

## Code Institute - Thired Milestone Project: Python Essentials Portfolio Project

## Overview
This program is a computerized version of the original hangman game, based inside a mock terminal deployed via Heroku.
As a child, I enjoyed the Hangman game a lot during my school days. It is popular as an educational tool to reinforce vocabulary and spelling skills.
Hangman is a classic word-guessing game in which one player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess it by suggesting letters. The word is represented by dashes, with each dash representing a letter in the word. The player guessing the word suggests letters one at a time, and if the guessed letter is in the word, the other player reveals all occurrences of that letter in the word. If the guessed letter is not in the word, a part of a stick figure (traditionally a gallows) is drawn as a tally of incorrect guesses.
The game continues until the guessing player successfully guesses the word or the stick figure is completely drawn (indicating too many incorrect guesses), resulting in a loss. The stick figure drawing often resembles a hanging person, which is why the game is called "Hangman."
